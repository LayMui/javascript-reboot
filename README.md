# JavaScript Reboot

Run the following commands to kickstart the challenge

```shell
# create the directory for this challenge and change to it
mkdir -p ~/code/javascript-reboot && cd $_

# download the challenge folder
git clone git@github.com:AshIgnYeo/javascript-reboot.git .

# remove previous git folder
rm -rf .git
```

## Objectives

The aim of this big challenge is to familiarise yourselves with the concepts of `querySelector`, `EventListeners`, `fetch`, trying to instil a sense of **Seperation of Concerns**, and making life terrible so that tomorrow makes sense.

I have consolidated the challenges that we have done yesterday into one **big** challenge so we're not introduced to anything new, but rather we can revisit things we know and apply them in a different context.

## How to run the challenges

This is a big challenge, and what I want to do is show you how we can break it down. Each challenge folder will be tackling a small portion of the overall challenge. It might/might not have tests because it is 3am and I am tired. ðŸ˜´

After you have completed each challenge, navigate to the next challenge folder and run the code there to transfer everything you have done to the next file.

## Notes

There are three essential files, the `index.html`, `style.css`, and `index.js`.

As this is going to be a JavaScript reboot, you should be able to make **EVERYTHING** work by changing only the `index.js` file.

When you are ready, click into [01-definition-api](https://github.com/AshIgnYeo/javascript-reboot/tree/main/01-dictionary) and get started! ðŸš€
